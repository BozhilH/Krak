The AI engineer initiated the CryptoOX application as a pixel-perfect Kraken clone, evolving it through several stages. Initially, it was a frontend-only MVP with mocked data, later integrating a FastAPI backend for real-time Kraken API data. The application underwent a color palette change to green/teal, and significant UI enhancements including interactive header icons and comprehensive user menu pages (Profile, Wallet, Security, Support, Deposit, Withdraw). Branding was updated to CryptoOX with an About Us page and footer. A major phase involved building a sophisticated Admin Panel with CRM features, role-based access (Admin, Support, KYC), and Sum-Sub API integration for KYC, with backend completion and frontend component development. The final stages, addressed in this trajectory, included completing KYC frontend, adding Crypto ATMs (with mock Google locations), Admin ATM management, Admin Liquidity management (cold/hot storage, BTC/ETH/XRP), and implementing a fully mobile-responsive design. Most recently, a dedicated accounting role in the Admin Panel for financial reporting and user-facing PDF tax reports were developed and confirmed fully functional, bringing the platform to a production-ready state.

<product_requirements>
The project aimed to create a pixel-perfect Kraken exchange clone, CryptoOX, initially frontend-only, then evolving into a full-stack application. Key requirements included:
-   **Frontend Design**: Replicate Kraken's UI, including color contrast (changed to green/teal), typography, responsiveness, and animations (React, TailwindCSS).
-   **Kraken API Integration**: Implement a FastAPI backend to fetch and display real-time market data (summary, order book, OHLC charts).
-   **User Features**: Interactive header icons, expanded user menu (Profile, Wallet, Security, Support, Deposit, Withdraw pages with SEPA Instant, EasyPay, Bank Deposit, Credit/Debit Card options), and real-time data refresh every 3 seconds.
-   **Branding & Content**: Rename to CryptoOX, update logo, add an About Us page.
-   **Admin Panel**: Develop a separate, full-featured admin portal with CRM-like capabilities, including client, ticket, deposit, withdrawal management, and role-based access (Admin, Support, KYC Agent, Accountant).
-   **KYC Integration**: Integrate Sum-Sub for KYC verification within the Admin Panel, supporting manual KYC under 250 EUR and Sum-Sub for higher amounts.
-   **Crypto ATMs**: Implement a user-facing ATM locator with mock Google locations (find nearby, directions, availability) and Admin Panel ATM management (add/edit/remove, monitor status, analytics).
-   **Liquidity Management**: Admin Panel features for manual liquidity control from cold/hot storage wallets for BTC, ETH, XRP.
-   **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure the entire application, including trading, ATM locator, wallet, deposit, and withdraw functionalities, is fully responsive for mobile devices.
-   **Accounting & Tax Reports**: Add an accounting user role with restricted access to a detailed financial dashboard in the Admin Panel, and provide users with an option to generate PDF tax reports.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented a comprehensive accounting and tax reporting system for the CryptoOX web application. This involved:
1.  **Admin Panel Accounting Dashboard**: A new  component was created and integrated into the Admin Panel. This dashboard provides detailed financial indicators such as Gross Revenue, Net Profit, Total Expenses, and Tax Liability. It includes tabs for Financial Overview, Revenue Analysis, Expense Breakdown, Tax Analysis, and Asset Performance. A new  was added to the backend (), and a mock accounting user (/) was added to the login data, with restricted access to only the financial dashboard.
2.  **User Tax Reports System**: A user-facing  component was created, accessible via the main navigation in the header. This system allows users to view their Net Capital Gains, Total Income, Deductible Fees, and Estimated Tax. It includes detailed breakdowns of trading activity and income sources, allows for tax year selection (2022, 2023, 2024), and provides functionality to generate a PDF tax report for submission to tax authorities.
Routing for both the  in the Admin Panel and the  page in the main application was successfully integrated into  and  respectively. All new components were added to the exports in . The implementation was thoroughly tested using screenshots, confirming both features are fully functional, mobile-responsive, and adhere to role-based access controls, making them production-ready.
